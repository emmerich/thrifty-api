Thrifty API
===========

The Thrifty API aims to provide a RESTful interface for accessing item data
for League of Legends.

It crawls the [League of Legends Wiki](http://www.leagueoflegends.wikia.com)
for information about items, parses it, and provides an interface for accessing
it.

Environment Setup
-----------------
You need Maven. Checkout the project and run `mvn clean jetty:run`. I'll add
documentation here about using JBoss and debugging with Jetty soon.
